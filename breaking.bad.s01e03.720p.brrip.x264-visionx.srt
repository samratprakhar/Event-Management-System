4
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,338
Let's break it down.

5
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,759
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?

6
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,762
By mole,
we're looking at 63 percent.

7
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,056
Sixty-three? Wow.
Mm-hm.

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,641
That is a big bite.

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,978
My next step's gotta be oxygen.
Oxygen, 26 percent.

10
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,355
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

11
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,984
Carbon, 9 percent.
Carbon, 9.

12
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,112
For a total of 98 percent.
Right.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,656
Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.

14
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,575
One-point-two-five.

15
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,077
That brings you
to 99 and a quarter.

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,247
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements

17
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,000
down where
the magic happens.

18
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,962
Oh, wait a minute. What about
calcium? Calcium's not a trace.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,047
Got a whole skeleton
to account for.

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,133
- You would think, right?
- Right.

21
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,636
- Calcium.
- Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

22
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,347
What? That low?
Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,516
Seriously?

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,435
Damn, I never
would've thought that.

25
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:47,440
Okay, so where does iron fit in?
Iron.

26
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,233
Wow, okay,

27
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:54,614
0.00004 percent.

28
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,534
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

29
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,579
Apparently, it don't take much.
No doubt. Go figure.

30
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,372
Ah, sodium.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,083
- Sodium, 0.04.

32
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,213
Phosphorus, 0.19.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,049
Point-one-nine.

34
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,967
There we go.

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,721
So the whole thing

36
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,057
adds up to...

37
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:25,394
99.888042 percent.

38
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:33,402
We are 0.111958 percent

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,655
shy.

40
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,533
Supposedly that's everything.
Yeah?

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,118
Mm-hm.

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,745
I don't know,
it just...

43
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,330
It just...

44
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,582
It seems like something's
missing, doesn't it?

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,839
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

46
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,037
I hate these shoes.

47
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,040
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans,

48
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,293
like I should be
squeaking around

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,879
bringing soup to some
disgusting old person,

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,047
then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

51
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,342
Then why are you
wearing them?

52
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,929
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely arch-y.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,601
Yo, what's up?

54
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,145
Hey, can you call me, like,
in two minutes?

55
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,813
Thanks, bye.

56
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,525
I gotta go take this.

57
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,486
Ooh. Female?

58
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,823
Louis.

59
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,410
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

60
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,662
Just be quick about it.
No.

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,167
Oh, and, um,
please don't say, "Yo."

62
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,128
You can't know
how much I hate that.

63
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,012
You missed a spot, right there.

64
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,847
Should you be up
on that ladder?

65
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,475
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

66
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,977
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

67
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,439
Yeah,
there's an idea.

68
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,736
So um, I'm, uh, I'm working
on this new short story

69
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,364
and there's this stoner
character in it

70
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,200
and I'm trying to... um...

71
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,993
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

72
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,370
Um, you, uh,

73
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,914
you smoked your fair share

74
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,291
of pot in college,
didn't you?

75
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,213
I mean,
you at least tried it.

76
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,008
Come on.

77
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:07,056
I perhaps tried it. Why?

78
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,558
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

79
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,852
Like,
changing it in any major way?

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,689
It made me more serious.

81
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,565
Really?

82
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,568
Because I mostly remember

83
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,071
it made me lightheaded,
that's about it.

84
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,365
I was just
wondering if...

85
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,909
If it maybe could, um...

86
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,246
Um, you know,

87
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,291
it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

88
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,670
Walter, Jr.'s on pot?
What? No.

89
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,547
No. No.

90
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,174
What would make you even...?
Where's he getting it from?

91
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,928
Marie.
Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

92
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,388
What are you gonna do
about this?

93
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,516
Marie,
you need to look me in the eye.

94
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,768
I am strictly asking

95
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,603
about a story that I'm writing,
that's all.

96
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,275
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot,

97
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,903
certainly not as far
as I know.

98
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,322
Not as far as you know?

99
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,950
Marie.

100
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,059
Hey, look at me.

101
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,020
Hey, turn around
and look at me.

102
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,779
This... This here.

103
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,574
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

104
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,287
This is degrading.

105
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,626
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,088
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

107
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,258
But I won't.

108
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,385
So either kill me,
or let me go.

109
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,681
You don't have it in you,
Walter.

110
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,604
How do you know my name?

111
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,732
Jesse.

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,151
He told Emilio and me.

113
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,404
I came by
to sell your meth.

114
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,533
So, what, did you
threaten him, huh?

115
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,411
Did you beat it out of him?
Not even close.

116
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,125
What else did he tell you?

117
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,004
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

118
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,632
You were his high-school
teacher.

119
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,967
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide

120
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,137
by making grape soda
in class.

121
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,264
You have a son
who's retarded,

122
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,141
or in a wheelchair
or something.

123
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,480
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

124
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,899
That partner of yours,

125
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,317
he's got a big mouth.

126
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,779
Walter,

127
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,448
I don't know what you think
you're doing here,

128
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,825
but trust me,

129
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,995
this line of work
doesn't suit you.

130
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,917
So I should just let you go,
then?

131
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,961
Just unlock you

132
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,672
and adiós, huh?

133
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,633
I don't see
what real choice you have.

134
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,262
If it's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

135
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,013
Besides...

136
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,183
your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

137
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,246
Occupied.

138
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,374
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one
off in here.

139
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,710
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

140
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,048
Okay.
What the hell, man?

141
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,718
What are you doing, man?

142
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,887
You asshole. What...?
You told him my name.

143
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,181
Says who, him?
My name, where I work.

144
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,809
You told him about my son.
Hey, don't touch me.

145
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,562
Damn junkie.
No, give me that. That's mine.

146
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,897
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

147
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,150
No, that's worth 40 grand,
you stupid shit.

148
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,569
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

149
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,738
Get off the toilet.

150
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,240
Get off the toilet!
No.

151
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,911
Get off the toilet.

152
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,414
Stop it.

153
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,086
No. No way.

154
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,788
No.

155
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,040
No, no, no.

156
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,793
Jesse, where the hell
do you think you're going?

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,586
Back off, man. Jesus.

158
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,962
We've got work to do.
No, no.

159
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,715
You... You got work to do.
I did my part.

160
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,385
You mean that obscenity I spent
the last two hours cleaning up?

161
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,471
That is your contribution?
Kiss my pink ass, man.

162
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,223
I didn't ask for any of this.

163
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,183
How am I supposed
to live here now, huh?

164
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,894
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

165
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,064
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

166
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,982
Oh, well, heil Hitler,
bitch.

167
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,402
And let me tell you
something else.

168
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,446
We flipped a coin,
okay?

169
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,157
You and me. You and me.

170
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,743
Coin flip is sacred.

171
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,506
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement,

172
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,842
as per the coin.

173
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,677
Fucking do it, already.

174
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,278
That's what she said.
Yeah.

175
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,948
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

176
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah, you'll have
to try them on.

177
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,535
Hello?
Seven and a half, maybe.

178
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,704
I don't know.
Excuse me.

179
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,872
Do you have these in black?

180
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,040
Uh-uh.

181
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,042
Anyways,
so like I was saying,

182
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,962
I went to the party the other
night. Yeah, Tony was there.

183
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
Whatever.

184
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,512
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

185
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,223
Sorry, baby, I'm, uh,
kind of busy here. What's up?

186
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,767
Well, kind of a lot, actually,

187
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,728
and it's a delicate subject.

188
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,105
So I need you to focus, and...

189
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,691
Hey, sit down! Sit down!

190
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,027
Damn it, Hank.

191
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,946
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just
in the middle of something here.

192
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,032
Get...

193
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,911
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
comprende? You too, sit down!

194
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,373
Shit.

195
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm back, babe. What's up?

196
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,214
Walter Jr.
Yeah, what about him?

197
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,759
Marijuana. He's smoking it.
Bullshit.

198
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,094
Excuse me, his own mother
seems to think so.

199
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,263
Skyler told you that?
She inferred it.

200
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,557
She inferred it, huh?

201
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,893
She strongly inferred it.

202
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,230
Like, "Doctor, my friend

203
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,524
suffers from
erectile dysfunction."

204
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,275
Please, come on.
All right.

205
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,611
I want you to talk to him.
Walt should talk to him.

206
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,780
Hell, Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt
up and down the block.

207
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,074
I think it ought to be you.

208
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,493
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

209
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,120
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

210
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,248
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

211
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,792
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know,

212
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,128
I figure his dad should be the
one doing this thing,
don't you think?

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,673
Hank, he respects you.

214
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,303
Yeah, all right.
Well, listen, I mean,

215
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,888
I'll swing by their place
after work.

216
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,808
Good. Scare him straight.
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,601
Hey, where's my sugar?

218
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,020
Hm. Muah.

219
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,066
Excuse me, ma'am.

220
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,486
Ma'am, you need to be wearing
footies before you try those on.

221
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,613
I'm extremely clean.

222
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,825
Yeah, well,
I'd really appreciate it.

223
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,788
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

224
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,250
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, gray ones.

225
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,169
My manager found them and we
put them back on the floor.

226
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,088
I know.

227
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,006
Hey.

228
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,716
I'm going.

229
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,429
- What do you think?
- About what?

230
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,890
This look like
a nice place?

231
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,768
No, not really.

232
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,062
Think you'd like
to live here?

233
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,064
No.

234
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,192
Sure about that?
Yeah, pretty sure.

235
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,445
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

236
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,156
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

237
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,409
Figure we'll come
over here and check
out how the other half lives.

238
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,204
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

239
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,207
You know who lives
in the palace? Meth-heads.

240
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,835
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads

241
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,129
who'd sell their grandma's
coochie for a hit.

242
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,966
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

243
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,469
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these

244
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,806
miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

245
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,015
Hm?

246
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,309
How do you think they started?
I don't know.

247
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,937
What do you think it was
they were all doing
before they graduated

248
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,190
to shooting meth
in their dicks?

249
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,777
A gateway drug.

250
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,612
That's what we call it.

251
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,156
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not,

252
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,285
that gateway drug was
marijuana, every time.

253
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,454
You understand?
Um, yeah.

254
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,666
So why are you
telling me this?

255
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,002
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

256
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,631
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

257
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,676
The world's a messed-up place,
you know.

258
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,263
You know, just this, uh,
one time, you know...

259
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,433
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

260
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,562
Yeah, you, princess.
Get over here.

261
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,817
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

262
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,489
Check this out.

263
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,576
See what
I'm talking about.

264
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,203
Hey, I ain't holding, okay?
Did I say you could open your mouth?

265
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,330
And hands off the car.

266
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,501
Other side. Go around the other
side, talk to my friend here.

267
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,506
What's your name,
sweetheart?

268
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,468
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

269
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,803
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

270
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,182
I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
Jesus, was that my question?

271
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,101
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

272
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,644
Are you on the pipe
or on the needle?

273
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,480
Nothing. Neither.

274
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,648
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

275
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,859
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

276
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:37,365
Oh, God. See that?
Pipe, definitely.

277
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,201
Bigtime, bigtime on the pipe.

278
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,952
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

279
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,246
Um, no, not really.

280
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,665
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

281
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,667
Sausages don't count.

282
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,006
Ahem. Seriously,
tell my friend here
how you got started.

283
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,217
Probably used to be, what,
like a Girl Scout

284
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,052
or probably sang
in the church choir?

285
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,720
What are you, like,
handicapped?

286
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,223
He broke his leg
playing football.

287
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,143
He's a QB.
Got an arm like a howitzer.

288
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,356
So tell me, Wendy,
you smoke pot?

289
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,607
Why, you got some?

290
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,401
All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

291
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,863
Hey, fair warning,
next time I'm gonna bust you.

292
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,831
So, what do you think?

293
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,084
Cool.

294
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,761
- Shut the door.
- Shut the door.

295
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,764
Lock it.
Lock it, lock it.

296
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,057
Who the hell was that?

297
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,935
Cop and some
football player
messing with me.

298
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,437
They ask about me, huh?

299
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,274
No,
I think they just wanted pot.

300
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,915
Right there.

301
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,543
Shit, left my root beer.

302
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,720
- Hello?
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

303
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,680
Listen, I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,349
The time, it just, ha...

305
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,517
It just... It completely
got away from me.

306
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,103
I'm just, ha... uh...

307
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,191
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late,

308
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,902
you know, doing some inventory,

309
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,696
and I, um, l... I should've just...

310
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,864
You know, you're right.

311
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:27,035
L-I gotta learn to say,
you know, "No."

312
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,371
But, um...

313
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,999
Sky? You there?

314
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,253
You're at the car wash?

315
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,547
Yeah.

316
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,217
I seriously doubt that,

317
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,053
since you quit two weeks ago.

318
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,729
I called Bogdan,
looking for you.

319
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,148
Quite an earful he gave me.

320
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,404
Listen...

321
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,906
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

322
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,827
I don't think so, Walt.
Honey...

323
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,913
Wherever you are,

324
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,207
why don't you just
stay there tonight?

325
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,836
Skyler? Skyler?

326
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,131
Skyler?

327
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,968
Walter?

328
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,594
Hello?

329
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,639
Hey, I'm kind of hungry
down here.

330
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,680
Oh.

331
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,031
Come on.

332
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,222
Damn.

333
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,225
I didn't think
you were coming back.

334
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,783
How long was I out?

335
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,827
Ten, 15 minutes?

336
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,374
I've never seen someone
knock themselves out
just by coughing.

337
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,751
You breathe in the same shit
you used on me?

338
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,095
I've got lung cancer.

339
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,247
I'll go make you
another sandwich.

340
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,745
It's safe.

341
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,830
There's no poison.

342
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,795
Because that would be
the way to do it,

343
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,838
if you're gonna do it.

344
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,550
I suppose it would.

345
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,094
I mean,

346
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,721
you being a chemist
and all.

347
00:26:55,906 --> 00:27:00,201
So that name...

348
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,662
Krazy-8.

349
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,039
Do I really
have to call you that?

350
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,541
I mean, no offense,

351
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,211
but don't you have a real name?

352
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:16,009
Domingo.

353
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,137
That's "Sunday," right?

354
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,226
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

355
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,770
Whatever.

356
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,481
I can't say
I ever liked it much.

357
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,863
So, Domingo,

358
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:41,075
you from around town here
or someplace else?

359
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,995
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me

360
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,873
is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

361
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,000
Not that I mind, you understand?

362
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,964
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

363
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,050
Well, maybe.

364
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,218
But maybe not.

365
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,141
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

366
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,770
I mean, any good reason at all.

367
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,944
Sell me.

368
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,364
Tell me what it is.

369
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,536
I guess I'd start off by
promising that if you let me go

370
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,873
I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

371
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,959
I guess I'd say
what happened between us

372
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,419
never happened.

373
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,298
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

374
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,842
But you know that
anybody in my situation

375
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,677
would make promises
like that.

376
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,180
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

377
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,015
You'll never know for sure.

378
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,105
So, what else can I tell you?

379
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,779
I don't know.

380
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,409
But you've gotta convince me.

381
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,955
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

382
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,166
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

383
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,169
I'm from here in town,
man.

384
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,880
ABQ, born and bred.

385
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,383
Never left.

386
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,886
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM,

387
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,431
got my degree.

388
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,182
Really?

389
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,397
Does that, uh, come in handy
in the drug trade?

390
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,066
It doesn't hurt.

391
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,236
I was gonna study
music originally.

392
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,197
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

393
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,701
My pops talked me
out of it.

394
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,910
Said there was
no money in it

395
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,580
unless I wind up
some bullshit rock star,

396
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,458
and I didn't have
a snowball chance of that.

397
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,295
What does your dad do?

398
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,589
He owns Tampico Furniture

399
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,716
over on Menaul.

400
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,052
Wait a minute,
I know that place.

401
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,599
Wait a minute. That's...

402
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,143
That's that... That, uh...

403
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,062
They used to have those...
Those late-night...

404
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,273
The stupid commercials.
That they had, yeah.

405
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,526
Yeah, that's him. Been doing
them for over 30 years.

406
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,572
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was, uh...

407
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,451
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

408
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,247
Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o

409
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:37,251
Just sing this short refrain-o

410
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,588
Our furniture is bueno
Our furniture is bueno

411
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,383
Tampico is the name-o
Tampico is the name-o

412
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,939
Pretty moronic.
But what can you do?

413
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,776
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

414
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,780
Did you write that? Being
the musician in the family.

415
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:09,909
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

416
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,537
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

417
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,289
His mind, it's like saying,

418
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,459
"Hey, I wrote
'Stairway to Heaven."'

419
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,297
Yeah, but at
Tampico Furniture, I...

420
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,841
I think when my son
was born

421
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,760
that we bought
his bassinet there.

422
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,054
Uh-uh.
We don't sell bassinets there.

423
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,931
It's more of a specialty item.

424
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,434
We did use to sell cribs.

425
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,145
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

426
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,481
Yeah. No, I remember that.

427
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,735
In fact, I remember
recognizing your dad

428
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,737
from those commercials.

429
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,449
Although he wasn't
anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

430
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,535
Yeah. No shit.

431
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,288
Did he, uh, try selling you
that extended warranty?

432
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,665
Yeah, he probably did.

433
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,209
And I was probably
dumb enough to buy it.

434
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,503
Yeah, that was his big thing.

435
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,255
You ask him
for a glass of water,

436
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,466
he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

437
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,931
Did you work there too?
Only my whole life.

438
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,101
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

439
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,567
So, uh...

440
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,737
16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

441
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,991
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

442
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,201
Might have even helped
ring you up.

443
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,164
You and your extended
warranty on the crib.

444
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,383
Small world.

445
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,219
It is.

446
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,557
The paths we take, huh?

447
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,876
Jesse know
you've got cancer?

448
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,923
No one but you.

449
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,093
Not your family?

450
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,929
No.

451
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,180
Why not?

452
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:45,147
Not a conversation that I'm even
remotely ready to have.

453
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,777
That's why you're cooking meth?

454
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,905
You wanna leave money
for your family.

455
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,701
Hell, I mean,

456
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,829
I'll write you a check right now
if you let me go.

457
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,962
Like I said, Walter,

458
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,298
this line of work
doesn't suit you.

459
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,139
Get out before it's too late.

460
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,981
I don't know what to do.

461
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,991
Yeah.

462
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,492
You do.

463
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,555
I'll get the key.

464
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,619
No.

465
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,122
Oh, no, no, no.

466
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,469
No. No. No, don't do this.

467
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,390
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

468
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,143
Why are you doing this?

469
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,595
You're doing the right thing,
Walter.

470
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,514
Yeah?

471
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,437
Do you wanna?

472
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,414
So you're not angry?

473
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,541
What do you mean?

474
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,044
Angry at you?

475
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,712
No.

476
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,423
Live and let live, man.

477
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,636
That's very understanding.

478
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,638
Whatever, man.

479
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,015
I just wanna go home.

480
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,729
Yeah.

481
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,898
Me too.

482
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,574
Unlock me, Walter.

483
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,259
The moment I do...

484
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,597
are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

485
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,711
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

486
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,796
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

487
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm so sorry.

488
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:55,768
I'm sorry.

489
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,062
I'm so sorry.

490
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,570
Hello?

491
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,114
Anybody down here?

492
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,351
Everybody,

493
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,270
I need you all to take your seats.

494
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,273
Settle down, please. Thank you.

495
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,485
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling

496
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,987
a little under the weather
this morning.

497
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,239
So you folks

498
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,159
are going to have to be
making do with me today.

499
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:03,664
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video

500
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,334
on carbon

501
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,877
Very important stuff.

502
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,257
So, what do you think?

503
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,842
- Ah, it's a cook site.
- Gotta be.

504
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,304
Nobody came way the hell
out here just to buy.

505
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,266
Fire there could have started
by accident.

506
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,477
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

507
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,939
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

508
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,484
So, what, they're in
some kind of camper/lab?

509
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,779
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

510
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,614
Yeah. Why not?

511
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,034
So why did that little
hair-gelled shit leave
his car?

512
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,246
Ay-yi-yi.

513
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,040
Gomey,
it's a culture in decline.

514
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,209
It's a rich
and vibrant culture.

515
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,878
It's a car that jumps
up and down.

516
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,255
What the hell?

517
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:56,675
You people used to be
conquistadors, for chrissake.

518
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:01,221
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

519
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,889
I already searched it.

520
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,309
Yeah.

521
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,227
You're wasting your time.

522
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,189
Give it up.
If this here's a trap car,

523
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,650
it's gonna take more than your
dumb white ass to find it.

524
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,738
Oh, yeah? You are talking to
the trap-car master,

525
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,989
my friend.

526
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,575
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

527
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,745
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
Retarded.

528
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,795
Yeah, baby.

529
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,510
Hello, zippy.
Asshole.

530
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,388
Sort of looks like meth
but it's, uh,

531
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,265
it's too damn white.

532
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,436
You know what I'm thinking,
Gomey?

533
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,314
Yep.
Somebody croaked our snitch.

534
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,066
Hey, agents.

535
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,193
You got something?

536
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,480
I don't know. It just...

537
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,066
It just doesn't it seem like...

538
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,985
Something's missing?

539
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,363
What about the soul?

540
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,502
The soul.

541
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,387
There's nothing
but chemistry here.

542
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,621
Skyler?

543
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,758
There's something
I have to tell you.
