2
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,845
Let's get something straight.

3
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,598
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

4
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,642
I am in charge
of the cooking.

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,645
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

6
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,026
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,487
I don't wanna see them,
I don't wanna hear from them.

8
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,491
I want no interaction with them
whatsoever.

9
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,248
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

10
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,917
You got
any issues with that?

11
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,170
Whatever, man.

12
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,845
No matter what happens,

13
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,139
no more bloodshed.

14
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,683
No violence.

15
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,697
Walt?
Mm.

16
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,283
You all right?
Oh, yeah.

17
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,244
Yeah, I'm okay.

18
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,998
You know, honey, you...
You really don't have to...

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,545
Look, I like being here with you.

20
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,005
Yeah.

21
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,175
I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay,

22
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,845
that really, if you wanna go...

23
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:04,433
You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better

24
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,312
knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. Gets home
from school.

25
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,985
Okay.

26
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,072
All right. So you'll call me
when you're finished?

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,991
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

28
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,122
Oh, uh, and have you been
in touch with Elliott?

29
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,834
Because I haven't seen
a check from him.

30
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,961
Yes, l... I got it.

31
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,298
Really?
It came, yeah. And l...

32
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,133
Yeah, it did. It came last week,

33
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,469
and I put it right into
my credit union account.

34
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,723
So I'm taking care of it.

35
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,310
Good.
Yeah.

36
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,479
So we're good. We're good.

37
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:58,613
Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

38
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,575
Thank you.

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,120
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

40
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,915
Yeah.

41
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,814
Chemical reactions involve
change on two levels:

42
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,525
Matter and energy.

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,740
When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

44
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,285
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

45
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:53,417
For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

46
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:01,467
But if a reaction happens quickly,

47
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,346
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

48
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:10,559
that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

49
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,813
Uh. Uh...

50
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:20,820
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,410
Hint, hint. Right here.

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,829
Like, an explosion?

53
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,291
Yes, good. Explosions.

54
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,963
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions

55
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,674
happening almost instantaneously.

56
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,428
And the faster reactants,
i.e. Explosives...

57
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,306
And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

58
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,685
The faster they undergo change,

59
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,855
the more violent the explosion.

60
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,652
Explosions.

61
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,947
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own

62
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:09,493
from the top of chapter seven,
all right?

63
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,759
You okay?

64
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,179
I got it, Mr. White.

65
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,014
Don't worry.

66
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,433
You got kids to teach.

67
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,830
Thanks, Hugo.

68
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,344
He's starting to lose weight,

69
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:13,265
which is tough, to see that.

70
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:19,522
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

71
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,365
Can I talk to...?
Of course.

72
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,909
Walt.

73
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,329
When you don't
let me in,

74
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,998
when you don't tell me
what's going on...

75
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,628
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

76
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,963
No.

77
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,967
And recently, these afternoons,

78
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,594
when you're coming home
so late,

79
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:55,474
and we're just left wondering
where you are.

80
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,852
Yeah, Dad.

81
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,355
What's up with that?

82
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:08,904
Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from
your family?

83
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,368
Now's the time to share.

84
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,375
Well, I, uh...

85
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,213
I like to be alone,
I mean, at times.

86
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,633
And it's not
about you, really.

87
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,762
It's just that sometimes
it feels better

88
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,684
not to talk at all

89
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,645
about anything

90
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,522
to anyone.

91
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,651
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

92
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,781
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

93
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,577
might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting

94
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,581
of whatever it is you do alone.

95
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,082
Yeah.

96
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,876
Well,

97
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,797
I like to go on walks

98
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,761
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

99
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:19,934
And I really enjoy the nature.

100
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,312
You know, the cacti,

101
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,816
vegetation, that kind of thing.

102
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:34,240
And it's really very therapeutic.

103
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,145
Yo, God, are you okay?

104
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,232
Hey, you did that shit?
I'm dizzy. No.

105
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,151
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

106
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,904
God, I feel like I'm burning up.
Sit down, sit down.

107
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,282
I gotta...
Take this off.

108
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,411
Sit down, get some air.

109
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,956
Oh, God.

110
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,208
Here.

111
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,256
Better?
Yeah, that's better.

112
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,140
When were you gonna tell me?

113
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,894
Tell you what?

114
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,063
Cancer.

115
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,316
You got it, right?

116
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,866
How did you know?

117
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,287
My aunt had one of those
dots on her

118
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,291
to target the radiation.
What, is it in your lung?

119
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,462
I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

120
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,590
God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

121
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,469
What stage are you?

122
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,264
Three-A.

123
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,435
Gone into your lymph nodes.

124
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,741
Your aunt,

125
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,578
how bad was she
when they caught it?

126
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,873
Bad enough,
she didn't last long.

127
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,836
How long?
Seven months.

128
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,842
God.

129
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,677
I get it now.

130
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,305
That's why you're doing all this.

131
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,725
You want to make
some cash for your people
before you check out.

132
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,894
You got a problem with that?
You tell me.

133
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,606
You're the one that
looks like he just crawled
out of a microwave.

134
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,489
You gonna be able to
finish the batch?

135
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,824
Yes.

136
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,784
All right.

137
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,581
No.

138
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,501
You do it.

139
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,672
Me?

140
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,424
Yeah.

141
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,844
What happened
to your mad skills?

142
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,227
Go on. Here.

143
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,020
You do it.

144
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,234
You can do it.

145
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,367
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

146
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:15,169
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

147
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,131
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

148
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,879
What's this, Christmas?

149
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,635
This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

150
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,182
Holy shit.
What?

151
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,644
Lab says they pulled up
an imprint of some old writing
used to be on the inside,

152
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,647
Magic Marker or something.
Yeah? What's it say?

153
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,275
"Property of
J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."

154
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,818
That's Walt's school.

155
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,525
We were supposed
to start at 3.

156
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,195
Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

157
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,533
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

158
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,003
How much is this?
Twenty-six big ones.

159
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,381
Is that all?
Twenty-six thousand dollars?

160
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,552
No, that's 2600,
and your share is 13,

161
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,056
minus 25 bucks
for that phone.

162
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,309
How much meth did you sell?
Nearly an ounce.

163
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,731
Last time I checked,

164
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,568
there were 16 ounces
to a pound. What did you do
with the rest, smoke it?

165
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,904
Yo, I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

166
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,115
You think it's cake
moving a pound of meth
one teenth at a time?

167
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,326
So why are you selling it
in such small quantities?

168
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,120
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

169
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,247
To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

170
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,835
This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

171
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,296
This return is too little
for the risk.

172
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,507
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

173
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,425
You may know a lot
about chemistry, man,

174
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,512
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

175
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,848
Well, I'll tell you,
I know a lack of
motivation when I see it.

176
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,975
Oh, my...

177
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,979
Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just...

178
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,607
Just think
outside the box here.

179
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,111
We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale.

180
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,281
Now, how do
we do that?

181
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,867
What do you mean,
to, like, a distributor?

182
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,661
Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

183
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,289
We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

184
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,584
Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

185
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,477
So who took Krazy-8's place?

186
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,188
Some guy named Tuco.

187
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,815
Badass, from what I hear.

188
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,403
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

189
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,531
Right. Like, "Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me,

190
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,993
but would you be interested
in a felony quantity
of methamphetamine?"

191
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,163
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship,
perhaps?

192
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,331
You just don't get it, man.
Okay? This guy's OG.

193
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,169
What... What does that mean?
Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

194
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,422
He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

195
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,758
You just don't understand
the way it works.

196
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,052
You can't just bum-rush
some high-level ice man

197
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,888
and start cutting deals.

198
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,725
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

199
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,852
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

200
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,897
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

201
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,690
And we can't talk to Emilio
either, because...

202
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,609
All right, all right, all right.

203
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:36,114
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

204
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,034
I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you just be satisfied

205
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,286
with the way it is?
Oh, come on! Jesus!

206
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,080
Just grow
some fucking balls!

207
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,544
Wow.

208
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:30,085
Wait till Monday again?
Yes, please. Thank you.

209
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,513
Oh, God.

210
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,033
Mr. White.

211
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,791
Thank you, Hugo.

212
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,318
Knock, knock.
Oh, hey.

213
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,822
How you feeling, Walt?
Good. Yeah.

214
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,700
Are you up for having a visitor?

215
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,370
Hey, buddy.
Hank.

216
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,497
Well, let me know
if you need anything, huh?

217
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,667
I will. Thank you, Carmen.
No problem.

218
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,253
Damn.

219
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,673
Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

220
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,386
So, what...?
What are you doing here?

221
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,766
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

222
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,851
You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

223
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,021
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

224
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,858
What do you mean,
"work-related," though?

225
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,446
Do you recognize that?

226
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,534
No. No.

227
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,704
Well, that was used to cook meth.

228
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,960
Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

229
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,922
Old label on the inside used to say:

230
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,133
"J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."
Really?

231
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,220
I don't understand
how that came from here.

232
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,305
Well, I was hoping
you could help me with that.

233
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,267
We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

234
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,313
A snitch?

235
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,482
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

236
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,234
Went missing a while back.

237
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,611
No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

238
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,742
Probably chopped up
into little pieces and
fed to the buzzards.

239
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,662
Anyway, you...

240
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,748
Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

241
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,668
No. No.

242
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,254
No, I mean,
not that I know of.

243
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,923
I'll need to look at that inventory.
Sure.

244
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,592
Sure. I've got a list
hanging on the wall.

245
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,012
Do you mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

246
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,097
Not at all. No.

247
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,099
Be my guest.

248
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,937
All right, so who's got keys?

249
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,606
The science faculty,
the staff, Carmen,

250
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,861
the vice-principal
has the master, and me.

251
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,988
How about students?

252
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,116
No, no. No students have keys.

253
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,285
Shit, I should hope not.
My question is,

254
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,288
do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

255
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,956
Uh... I don't...
I don't think so, no.

256
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,209
I mean, besides,
I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

257
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,879
Walt, look,
I know they're your students,

258
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,506
but do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

259
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,718
Are there any other respirators?
Um, no.

260
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,054
Because I'm counting six,
inventory says eight.

261
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,724
Hm.

262
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,144
Glassware looking a little sparse.
Is it?

263
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:22,317
Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

264
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,069
Oh, yeah.

265
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,864
A five-thousand milliliter
round-bottom.

266
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,033
Meth heads love
to brew in this baby.

267
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:36,081
You gonna answer that?
Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...

268
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,083
Maybe it's Skyler
and she's in trouble
or something.

269
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,253
I mean, shit, don't ignore it
on my account. Answer it.
Come on, I got stuff to do.

270
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,881
Jeez.
Okay.

271
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,469
- Hello?
- Yo, what's up, Mr. W?

272
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,763
Speaking.

273
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,265
Bad time to talk?
Absolutely.

274
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,017
All right, so just listen.

275
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,229
So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

276
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,732
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him

277
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,192
over at Los Lunas.

278
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,197
So we got our in. We're hauling
a pound to the dude right now.

279
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,576
Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

280
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,456
My doctor is very solicitous.

281
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,210
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

282
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,213
But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

283
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,299
You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

284
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,801
I will.

285
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,054
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

286
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,648
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

287
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,237
So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

288
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,240
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

289
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,466
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

290
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,637
Skinny dick.

291
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,770
Maybe this isn't such
a good idea, yo. Come on.

292
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,986
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

293
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,126
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

294
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,305
No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

295
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:15,156
Tuco, what's happening,
my brother?

296
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,916
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

297
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,044
What's it been, like, a year?
This your boy?

298
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,089
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

299
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,341
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

300
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,010
Break out the ice.

301
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,656
Take a bump.
No worries, man, I'm no cop.

302
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,701
I said, hit it.

303
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,247
All right.

304
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,807
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

305
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,811
Where'd you get it?
I cooked it.

306
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,897
Bullshit.

307
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,609
Who you working for?

308
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,073
No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that
I cook with, but that's it.

309
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,578
All right.

310
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,749
We got a deal.

311
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,834
See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

312
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,920
Cool. I haven't said how much.

313
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,766
All right. How much?

314
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,768
Thirty-five large for the pound.

315
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,776
Well, I mean,
you're a little light, ese.

316
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,490
It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

317
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,617
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

318
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,621
What about the money?
You'll get it.

319
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,498
This is a consignment operation.

320
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,461
You want me to float
thirty-five G's?

321
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,881
You don't trust me?

322
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,050
Hey, no, no, hey.
It's not that, man.

323
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,387
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

324
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,306
Tough shit, the deal is done.

325
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:51,646
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

326
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,898
Don't front, dude,
Tuco's good for it.

327
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,152
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

328
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,200
Come on.

329
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,328
Oh, come on.

330
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,178
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal. Hoo!

331
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,723
You really want your
money up front?

332
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,582
Up front.

333
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:28,576
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

334
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,931
Morning, Hugo.

335
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:55,019
You don't mind if I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

336
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,400
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

337
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,277
Is that Uncle Hank?

338
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,782
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

339
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,619
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

340
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,289
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

341
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,459
I got two words for you:
Background check. How about that?

342
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,965
Yo, yo, yo. 1-4-8, 3-to-the-3,
to-the-6, to-the-9.

343
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,093
Representing the ABQ.
What up, beyotch?

344
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,427
Leave it at the tone.

345
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,974
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

346
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,518
- Hey, Walt?
- Yeah?

347
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:40,982
Hank's about to deal.
Okay, I'll be right there.

348
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,781
All right, let's see
what the turn brings us.

349
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,995
You're looking good, Walt.
Your color's better.

350
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,997
Yeah? Thanks.

351
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,000
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

352
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,837
Dr. Delcavoli's trying
to talk him into taking
some time off from work, but...

353
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,673
Well, actually,
I just talked to
Carmen this morning,

354
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,843
and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

355
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,011
Oh.
Good for you.

356
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,555
I just didn't
have a chance to tell you. Sorry.

357
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,223
Your bet, tough guy.

358
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,142
Check.

359
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,019
Yeah, check.

360
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,396
Check's in the mail.

361
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,983
Ten million.
That's 25 million, blue's 10.

362
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,986
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

363
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,030
Hey, Uncle Hank, um,

364
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,200
why were you arresting
Mr. Archilleya the other day?

365
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,493
He's a pretty cool guy.

366
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:40,499
Well, turns out he has
a record. Yeah, a couple
of possession beefs.

367
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,211
We figured he was
the guy that was stealing
your school's chemistry gear.

368
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,674
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

369
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,094
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

370
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,556
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

371
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,560
It's to you, Walt.
Yeah, I'll call.

372
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,896
You know, I can't believe
the school system

373
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,898
didn't know about
this guy's record.

374
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,692
I mean, that's pretty scary.
How could something like that

375
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,236
- just slip through the cracks?
- I don't know.

376
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:14,575
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as a thief.

377
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,120
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal

378
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,082
if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

379
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:27,713
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

380
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,549
Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

381
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,177
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

382
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,804
You hiding something?

383
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,189
I'm in. And the river card.

384
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,608
Oh.

385
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,777
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

386
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm out.

387
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,158
Yowza.

388
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,995
When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

389
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,748
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

390
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,627
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

391
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,423
Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

392
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,427
Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

393
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,722
I'm waiting.

394
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,309
You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

395
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,145
Hank.

396
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,314
What? Sorry.

397
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,944
I'm all in.

398
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:41,120
No, no, no. You bad,
bad, bad, horrible liar.

399
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,708
What are you smoking there, huh?

400
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,502
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

401
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,135
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy.
I fold.

402
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,181
- Talk about anticlimactic.
- Hey.

403
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,641
Your cards couldn't
have been that bad,
come on.

404
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,977
Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace?

405
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:09,857
- What are you doing?
- And a cowboy for what?

406
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,860
Oh.

407
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,405
A handful of nothing.

408
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,589
Yeah, what up?

409
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,302
Who is this?
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

410
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,264
Hey, man, he's out.

411
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,100
Well, where is he, then?

412
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,782
You the guy?

413
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah, I'm the guy.

414
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,625
How is he?

415
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:55,254
Got some busted ribs,
and like that.

416
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,798
Got messed up pretty good.

417
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,428
I was all, like,
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

418
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,973
I don't know what got
into him. Seriously.

419
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,103
Oh, he's out, man. Way out.

420
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,398
They got him
doped up big time.

421
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,780
So you're the cook, huh?

422
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,327
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

423
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,676
Tell me about this Tuco.

424
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,721
Tell me everything about him.

425
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,825
Morning.

426
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,830
Could you pass the butter, please?

427
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,084
Badass, Dad.

428
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:30,344
- Hey, cue ball.
- Need some directions?

429
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,514
You Tuco?

430
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:43,440
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

431
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,775
What's your name?

432
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,612
Heisenberg.

433
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,449
Heisenberg. Okay.

434
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,326
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

435
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,288
I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

436
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,456
No?

437
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,292
All right.

438
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,878
Be that way.

439
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,382
It's your meeting.

440
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,802
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

441
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,722
Fifty thousand dollars.

442
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,686
Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

443
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,397
Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole,

444
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,400
and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

445
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,033
Partner.

446
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,418
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

447
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,712
So you must be Daddy.

448
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,431
Let me get this straight.

449
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,935
I steal your dope,

450
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,856
I beat the piss
out of your mule boy,

451
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,195
and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

452
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,909
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

453
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,619
Brilliant.

454
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,832
You got one part of that wrong.

455
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,422
This is not meth.

456
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,326
Are you fucking nuts?

457
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,910
You wanna find out?

458
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,789
No, no, Gonzo, calma.

459
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,589
You got balls, I'll give you that.

460
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:39,384
All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

461
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,934
That crystal
that your partner brought me,

462
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:53,148
it sold faster than 10-dollar ass
in TJ.

463
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:00,781
Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

464
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,619
Money up front.

465
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,788
All right.

466
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,956
Money up front.

467
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,798
Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

468
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,677
Just as long as we got
an understanding.

469
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,726
One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

470
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,359
Oh, really?

471
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,488
